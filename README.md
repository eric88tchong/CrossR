# CrossR 
HIIT Exercises for the R User

Instructors can levarage `CrossR` to lead R Users through high-intensity
interval training (HIIT) exercise sessions. These sessions guide R Users through
simple, hands-on coding activities repetitiously for 20-90 seconds at a time.
The goal is to help R Users become more fluent with the R programming language
and RStudio's shortcuts, while keeping things challenging and fun.

## Installation

``` r
